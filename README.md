# Student Performance Analysis and NEET Rank Prediction

This project is a web application built using Python's `Streamlit` framework that helps students analyze their performance, predict their NEET rank, and receive personalized recommendations for improvement. The app uses data processing, data visualization, and PDF report generation to provide a comprehensive analysis of student performance.

## Features

- **Performance Summary:** Display a student's performance based on their scores.
- **Weak Areas Identification:** Identify subjects where the student needs improvement.
- **Topic Distribution Visualization:** Display average scores per subject using a bar chart.
- **Predicted NEET Rank:** Predict the student's NEET rank based on their performance.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provide actionable advice based on the student's weaknesses.
- **PDF Report Generation:** Generate a downloadable PDF report containing all the data and recommendations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- FPDF

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-performance-analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

## Code Explanation

### 1. **Data Preparation**

The app starts by creating a sample dataset for the student’s performance. The dataset contains:

- `User ID`
- `Average Score`
- `Predicted Rank`

The data is structured into a `DataFrame` using the `pandas` library for easy manipulation and display.

### 2. **Performance Summary**

The student’s performance is displayed in a table format. The data includes the `Average Score` and `Predicted Rank`.

### 3. **Weak Areas**

The app identifies weak subjects based on average scores and the number of attempts. In this case, it focuses on Physics and provides a `Weakness Level`.

### 4. **Topic Distribution**

The app visualizes the student's performance in different subjects using a bar chart. The topics are:

- Physics
- Chemistry
- Biology

### 5. **Predicted NEET Rank**

Using the `Predicted Rank` from the data, the app displays the student's predicted NEET rank.

### 6. **Recommendations for Improvement**

Personalized recommendations are provided based on the student’s weak areas. The app suggests focusing on specific subjects and improving time management skills.

### 7. **PDF Report Generation**

The app can generate a PDF report containing all the performance analysis, weak areas, and recommendations. The user can download the report by clicking a button.

### 8. **Streamlit UI**

The app is interactive, with various sections for each feature and data visualization. It’s built using `Streamlit`, allowing for seamless integration of data processing, visualization, and user interaction.
